            'This weather sensor (ideally based on a weather integration)
            is used for further temperature comparisons based on the forecast. This
            sensor is also used to compare weather conditions. Leave empty if the
            forecast is not to be used in any case. <p> Select either a weather entity
            (e.g., weather.your_weather_service) or a sensor that provides the forecasted
            daily maximum temperature. </p> <p> **Weather Entity:** If you select
            a weather entity, the maximum temperature will be automatically determined
            from its forecast attributes. This is necessary if your installed weather
            integration does not provide its own sensors for the forecast. </p> <p>
            **Sensor Entity:** If you already have your own sensor for the daily maximum
            temperature (forecast) (e.g., a template sensor), you can specify it directly
            here. This can improve performance and avoid unnecessary queries, as the
            value is read directly from the sensor. Such a sensor is provided, for
            example, by the Pirate Weather integration (sensor.pirateweather_daytime_high_apparent_temperature_0d).

            The idea is that it can happen, especially in spring, that the value of
            the <em>Forecast Temperature Value</em> exceeded by strong solar radiation
            and the shading would be started. However, in spring you may not want
            shading, but the solar radiation as a welcome, free heating is desired.
            So you can define via the forecast sensor that shading is only started
            at an expected daily maximum temperature.

            You can also specify an existing sensor if it already provides the forecast
            for the maximum daily temperature. In this case set "Sun Shading Forecast
            Type" to "Do not use a weather forecast, but the current weather attributes".
